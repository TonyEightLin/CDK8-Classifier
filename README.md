# CDK8-Ensemble

**Currently under peer review**

This repository holds the data and code associated with the manuscript **A consensus machine learning model to generate a
focused screening library for the identification of CDK8 inhibitors**. Scripts include the generation of Machine Learning
models and the generated similarity matrix. Datasets used for training are also provided.

The main scripts for the project can be found under the **cdk8classifier/** folder. Datasets for training or generating 
figures associated with the manuscript can be found under the **resources/** folder. The **configs.yaml** file contains 
parameter suggestions generated from hyperopt tuning.

This project generated models for classification models for CDK8 inhibitors. Six models were generated:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Random Forest (RF)
- C-Support Vector (SVC)
- XGBoost (XG)
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

**Manuscript will be linked upon successful publication**
